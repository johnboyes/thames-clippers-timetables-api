# thames-clippers-timetables-api

Thames Clippers timetable data in a [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) API.

This GraphQL API is not itself an official TFL API - the source data is though, from [TFL's open data](https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/open-data-users/) API.

## Running the test suite

`bundle exec rspec`
